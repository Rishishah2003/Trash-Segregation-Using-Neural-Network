# Trash-Segregation-Using-Neural-Network
In this, we have segregated seven types of waste using an asymmetric network and a convolutional neural network. The types of waste are ewaste, metal, glass, plastic, and many more, so we used Softmax. ANN is not as good in classification so we used CNN for classification as the accuracy of ANN was too low
